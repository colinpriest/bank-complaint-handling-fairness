## Temporal Analysis

### 2024 Data:
- All demographic groups within 0.228 tier range
- Relatively low bias range compared to product/geographic variations
- Suggests **contextual factors more important than temporal**

## Key Contextual Insights

### 1. Context Amplifies Bias
- **Product type** influences bias magnitude significantly
- **Geographic location** can double bias ranges
- **Company-specific** practices create extreme disparities
- **Context > Demographics** in determining bias severity

### 2. Intersectional Complexity
- **Age discrimination** more severe than racial bias in some contexts
- **Product-demographic interactions** create complex patterns
- **Rural vs urban** dynamics vary by product category
- **Traditional bias assumptions** don't hold across all contexts

### 3. Surprising Patterns
- **Mortgage bias favors Black women** (-1.211 bias)
- **Banking services discriminate against seniors** most severely
- **Hispanic males** get favorable treatment in auto loans
- **White affluent males** don't uniformly get best treatment

### 4. Actionable Implications
- **Product-specific** bias mitigation needed
- **Geographic** disparities require regional interventions
- **Company training** should focus on highest-bias firms
- **Age discrimination** deserves equal attention to racial bias

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Focus on highest-bias products**: Mortgages, prepaid cards, auto loans
2. **Target highest-bias states**: MS, KY, IN, CO, AL
3. **Prioritize highest-bias companies**: Westlake, Navy Federal, M&T Bank
4. **Address age discrimination**: Senior citizens show worst overall treatment

### Strategic Approach:
1. **Context-aware fairness metrics** rather than uniform approaches
2. **Product-specific bias mitigation strategies**
3. **Geographic fairness monitoring** and regional interventions
4. **Company-level bias auditing** and targeted training

This contextual analysis reveals that bias is not uniform - it's amplified by specific products, companies, and geographic contexts, requiring targeted interventions rather than blanket solutions.
