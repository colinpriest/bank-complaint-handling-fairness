# Why Eta-Squared Misleads for Tier Assignment Analysis

## The Problem

You're correct - the Black vs Asian disparity IS large, despite eta-squared = 0.003 suggesting "negligible" effect.

## The Numbers

**Observed Differences:**
- Asian mean tier: 0.558
- Black mean tier: 0.476
- **Difference: 0.082 (17.2% higher for Asian)**

**Yet eta-squared = 0.003 (negligible)?**

## Why Eta-Squared Fails Here

### 1. **Discrete Outcome Problem**

Tiers are discrete values (0, 1, 2), not continuous. This creates inherently high within-group variance:
- Standard deviations ~0.6 for all groups
- Within-group SS: 3,640
- Between-group SS: 10.5
- **Result**: Between-group differences get swamped

### 2. **The Mathematics**

```
Eta-squared = Between-group variance / Total variance
            = 10.5 / 3,650
            = 0.003
```

The huge within-group variance (from discrete outcomes) makes between-group differences look trivial.

### 3. **Practical Impact Gets Hidden**

The 0.082 mean difference actually represents:
- **~4% more Tier 2 (monetary compensation) for Asian applicants**
- **~4-8% more Tier 0 (no action) for Black applicants**
- **17% relative difference in mean outcomes**

## Better Metrics for Tier Analysis

### 1. **Tier Distribution Comparison**
Instead of means, compare actual tier distributions:
- % getting Tier 0 by ethnicity
- % getting Tier 1 by ethnicity
- % getting Tier 2 by ethnicity

### 2. **Disparity Ratios**
- Selection ratio: Black/Asian = 0.853 (close to 80% rule violation)
- Tier 2 rate ratio
- Tier 0 rate ratio

### 3. **Odds Ratios**
- Odds of monetary compensation (Tier 2) by ethnicity
- Odds of no action (Tier 0) by ethnicity

### 4. **Cohen's h for Proportions**
Better than Cohen's d for discrete outcomes

## The Real Story

**Eta-squared says**: "Negligible effect (0.003)"

**Reality shows**:
- 17% higher mean tier for Asian vs Black
- Close to failing 80% rule (85.3%)
- Meaningful differences in monetary compensation rates
- Substantial fairness concern requiring investigation

## Recommendation

For tier assignment analysis, we should:

1. **Report tier distribution percentages** not just means
2. **Use disparity ratios** for each tier level
3. **Apply 80% rule** to tier assignments
4. **Calculate practical impact** (e.g., monetary compensation rates)
5. **Avoid relying on eta-squared** for discrete outcomes

## Code Solution

Instead of just ANOVA on means, analyze:

```python
def analyze_tier_disparities(data):
    results = {}

    # For each ethnicity, calculate tier distributions
    for ethnicity in ethnicities:
        tier_0_rate = (data[ethnicity]['tier'] == 0).mean()
        tier_1_rate = (data[ethnicity]['tier'] == 1).mean()
        tier_2_rate = (data[ethnicity]['tier'] == 2).mean()
        results[ethnicity] = {
            'tier_0_rate': tier_0_rate,
            'tier_1_rate': tier_1_rate,
            'tier_2_rate': tier_2_rate
        }

    # Calculate disparity ratios for tier 2 (monetary)
    tier_2_disparities = {}
    for eth1 in ethnicities:
        for eth2 in ethnicities:
            if eth1 != eth2:
                ratio = results[eth1]['tier_2_rate'] / results[eth2]['tier_2_rate']
                tier_2_disparities[f'{eth1}_vs_{eth2}'] = ratio

    # Check 80% rule for each tier
    for tier in [0, 1, 2]:
        check_80_percent_rule(tier_rates)

    return results
```

## Bottom Line

You were right to question the "negligible" effect size. Eta-squared is the wrong metric for discrete tier outcomes. The Black-Asian disparity IS material and concerning, requiring investigation despite the small eta-squared value.
