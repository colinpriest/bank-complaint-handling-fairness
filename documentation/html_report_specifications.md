# LLM Fairness Dashboard

## Recent Updates and Fixes (September 2024)

### Process Bias Analysis Improvements

- **Fixed SQL Query Issues**: Resolved ambiguous column references in process bias queries by properly qualifying table aliases
- **Corrected Data Source**: Removed unnecessary joins with `llm_cache` table and now query `experiments` table directly for more accurate results
- **Fixed Inflated Counts**: Eliminated non-unique join issues that were causing experiment counts to be multiplied by cache entries
- **Improved Data Filtering**: Enhanced filtering logic to properly separate zero-shot vs n-shot experiments and exclude bias mitigation strategies
- **Type Safety**: Added explicit float conversions to prevent decimal/float type mismatches in statistical calculations

### HTML Dashboard Enhancements

- **Number Formatting**: Updated count columns to display as comma-formatted integers (e.g., "1,230" instead of "1,230.0")
- **Report Generation**: Fixed HTML report generation to work properly without requiring `--report-only` flag
- **Data Integration**: Improved integration between `extract_question_rate_data.py` and HTML dashboard for process bias results
- **Statistical Analysis**: Enhanced statistical test calculations with proper type handling

### Database Schema Updates

- **Added Missing Columns**: Added `vector_embeddings` column to `experiments` table for embedding storage
- **Improved Data Integrity**: Enhanced data validation and error handling in database operations

### Performance and Reliability

- **TensorFlow Warning Suppression**: Added environment variables and warning filters to suppress TensorFlow deprecation warnings
- **API Error Handling**: Fixed OpenAI API calls with proper parameter handling
- **Sample Size Control**: Corrected `--sample-size` parameter to properly limit experiment generation
- **Cache Management**: Improved LLM cache handling and reduced redundant API calls

## Navigation Structure

The dashboard uses a **two-level tab system** for improved navigation:

### Main Tabs (Top Level):

1) **Headline Results** – default to showing this tab
2) **Persona Injection**
3) **Severity and Bias**
4) **Bias Mitigation**
5) **Ground Truth Accuracy**

### Sub-Tabs (Within Each Main Tab):

Each main tab contains multiple sub-tabs to organize content by analysis type:

- **Headline Results**: Persona Injection, Severity & Bias, Bias Mitigation, Ground Truth
- **Persona Injection**: Tier Recommendations, Process Bias, Gender Bias, Ethnicity Bias, Geographic Bias
- **Severity and Bias**: Tier Recommendations, Process Bias
- **Bias Mitigation**: Tier Recommendations, Process Bias
- **Ground Truth Accuracy**: Overview, Method Comparison, Strategy Analysis

## User Interface Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Navigation**: Click to switch between main tabs and sub-tabs
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between main tabs and sub-tabs
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified design language across all navigation elements
- **Auto-Reset**: Sub-tabs reset to first tab when switching main tabs

* * H0: the mean tier is the same with and without persona injection
  * statistical test name
  * test statistic
  * p-value
  * Conclusion: whether the null hypothesis was accepted or rejected
  * Implication:
    * If H0 was rejected and the persona-injected mean is higher, it means that the LLM is more generous on average when it sees humanising attributes, somewhat analogous to a display of empathy.
    * If H0 was rejected and the persona-injected mean is higher, it means that the LLM is less generous on average when it sees humanising attributes.
    * If H0 was accepted, it means that, on average, sensitive human attributes don't change the recommended remedy tier.
