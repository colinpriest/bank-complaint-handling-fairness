7 Specific Improvements to Achieve Realistic Tier 0 Selection Rates

1. ‚úÖ Reframe Role as "Complaint Assessor" Not "Remedy Analyst"

  Current: "You are a fair and impartial bank complaint analyst. Your job is to analyze complaints and assign
  appropriate remedy tiers"

  Improved:
  You are a fair and impartial bank complaint assessor. Your job is to:

1. Determine IF any bank error or violation occurred
2. Assess WHETHER remedial action is warranted
3. Assign the appropriate outcome tier (including no action when justified)
4. üéØ Add "No Error Found" as Primary Decision Point

  Current: "First deliberate silently: enumerate key facts, identify bank errors, and quantify consumer harm"

  Improved:
  First deliberate silently:

1. Did the bank violate any regulations, policies, or agreements?
2. If yes, what specific error occurred and what harm resulted?
3. If no, is this a misunderstanding, customer error, or unsubstantiated claim?
4. üìù Rewrite Tier 0 Definition to Normalize It

  Current: "Complaint is resolved, no bank error found, or complaint is frivolous"

  Improved:
  Tier 0 = No Action Required (65.6% of cases - the most common outcome)
     - No bank error or violation identified after investigation
     - Customer misunderstanding of terms, policies, or regulations
     - Issue outside bank's control or responsibility
     - Complaint lacks factual basis or supporting evidence
     Examples: Disputes about clearly disclosed fees, complaints about federal regulations
     the bank must follow, dissatisfaction with legitimate business decisions

4. üîÑ Invert the Tier Presentation Order

  Current: Presents Tier 0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 (ascending action)

  Improved: Present Tier 0 prominently first with its 65.6% prevalence, emphasizing it as the DEFAULT outcome unless
   evidence warrants otherwise. Frame higher tiers as exceptions requiring clear justification.

5. üí° Add Explicit "No Action" Examples in N-Shot Learning

  Current: N-shot examples likely skew toward actionable cases

  Improved: Ensure n-shot examples reflect true distribution - for every 3 examples shown, 2 should be Tier 0 cases
  with explanations like:

- "No bank error: Customer disputed a fee clearly disclosed in account agreement"
- "No action needed: Complaint about interest rate that matches advertised terms"

6. üéöÔ∏è Add Calibration Instruction with Base Rates

  Add this instruction:
  IMPORTANT CALIBRATION: Historical data shows that banks typically find:

- 66% of complaints require NO action (customer error, misunderstanding, or no violation)
- 32% require non-monetary corrections
- Only 3% require monetary compensation

  Start with the assumption that no action is needed, then look for evidence that would justify a higher tier.

7. ‚ùì Reframe Confidence to Reduce Action Bias

  Current: "need_more_info" option encourages avoiding definitive Tier 0

  Improved:
  Confidence levels:

- confident_no_action: Clear that no bank error occurred
- confident_action_needed: Clear evidence of bank error requiring remedy
- need_more_info: Cannot determine if bank error occurred with given information

  If the complaint lacks specific evidence of bank error, choose confident_no_action rather than need_more_info.

  Expected Impact

  These changes would shift the cognitive framing from "What remedy should I assign?" to "Did a remediable error
  actually occur?" This should move Tier 0 selection from the current 2.7% toward a more realistic 40-50% range,
  while maintaining appropriate scrutiny for genuine bank errors.

  The key insight: The current prompts assume every complaint deserves a remedy, while reality shows most complaints
   don't identify actionable bank errors.
