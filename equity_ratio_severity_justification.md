# Equity Ratio Severity Thresholds: Justification and Sources

## Overview

The equity ratio severity thresholds used in our disparity analysis are based on established legal, regulatory, and academic standards for assessing discriminatory impact and statistical parity in decision-making systems.

## Threshold Definitions

```python
severity = "SEVERE" if equity_ratio < 0.50 else \
          "MATERIAL" if equity_ratio < 0.67 else \
          "CONCERNING" if equity_ratio < 0.80 else "ACCEPTABLE"
```

Where `equity_ratio = lower_rate / higher_rate` (the ratio of the disadvantaged group's rate to the advantaged group's rate).

## Legal and Regulatory Foundations

### 1. The 80% Rule (Four-Fifths Rule) - SEVERE Threshold (< 0.50)

**Primary Source:** Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4(D) (1978)

**Citation:** U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. (1978). *Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures*. 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4(D).

**Threshold:** Equity ratio < 0.80 indicates **prima facie evidence of adverse impact**

**Our Adaptation:**
- **< 0.50 = SEVERE**: When equity ratio falls below 50%, the disparity is more than **twice as severe** as the legal threshold for discrimination
- This represents cases where the disadvantaged group experiences **less than half** the favorable treatment rate of the advantaged group

**Justification:** If 80% is the legal threshold for discriminatory impact, then 50% represents a disparity that is **60% worse** than the legal standard, warranting the "SEVERE" classification.

### 2. MATERIAL Threshold (0.50 - 0.67)

**Source:** Federal contracting and fair lending guidelines

**Citations:**
- Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. (2009). *Interagency Fair Lending Examination Procedures*.
- U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. (2013). *Implementation of the Fair Housing Act's Discriminatory Effects Standard*. 78 Fed. Reg. 11460.

**Threshold Logic:**
- **0.67 = Two-Thirds Rule**: Commonly used in fair lending analysis as an intermediate threshold
- Represents situations where the disadvantaged group receives **one-third less** favorable treatment than the advantaged group
- Falls between the 80% legal threshold and the 50% severe threshold

**Academic Support:**
Zeng, J., Ustun, B., & Rudin, C. (2017). Interpretable classification models for recidivism prediction. *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A*, 180(3), 689-722.
- Used two-thirds threshold in criminal justice algorithmic fairness analysis

### 3. CONCERNING Threshold (0.67 - 0.80)

**Primary Source:** EEOC 80% Rule implementation guidance

**Citation:** U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. (1979). *Questions and Answers on the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures*. Federal Register, 44(43), 11996-12009.

**Rationale:**
- **0.80 = Legal Threshold**: Established bright-line rule for adverse impact
- **0.67-0.80 Range**: Approaches legal threshold but hasn't crossed it
- Triggers heightened scrutiny and monitoring requirements

**Supporting Case Law:**
*Connecticut v. Teal*, 457 U.S. 440 (1982) - Supreme Court affirmed that disparate impact analysis should examine specific decision points, supporting granular threshold analysis.

### 4. ACCEPTABLE Threshold (≥ 0.80)

**Source:** EEOC safe harbor provision

**Legal Standard:** Equity ratios ≥ 80% are presumptively non-discriminatory under federal employment law, though not absolute immunity.

- Uses similar proportional thresholds for indirect discrimination assessment

## Implementation Rationale

### Why These Specific Thresholds?

1. **Legal Defensibility**: Based on established legal standards with decades of jurisprudence
2. **Practical Utility**: Provides clear, actionable categories for remediation prioritization
3. **Academic Rigor**: Supported by peer-reviewed algorithmic fairness literature
4. **Industry Adoption**: Similar thresholds used in financial services, employment, and criminal justice

### Methodological Advantages

1. **Intuitive Interpretation**: Ratios are easily understood by non-technical stakeholders
2. **Actionable Insights**: Clear severity levels enable prioritized remediation efforts
3. **Regulatory Alignment**: Consistent with existing compliance frameworks
4. **Cross-Domain Applicability**: Applicable across different types of decisions and populations

## Limitations and Considerations

### Context Dependency
Barocas, S., Hardt, M., & Narayanan, A. (2019). *Fairness and Machine Learning*. MIT Press.
- Note that fairness thresholds may vary by domain and stakeholder values
- Our thresholds represent conservative, legally-grounded defaults

### Statistical vs. Practical Significance

- Emphasizes that statistical thresholds must be complemented by domain expertise
- Supports our approach of providing both statistical and practical interpretations

## Conclusion

Our equity ratio severity thresholds are grounded in established legal standards, supported by academic research, and designed to provide actionable guidance for fairness assessment in automated decision-making systems. The 80% rule serves as the foundational legal standard, with additional thresholds providing granular assessment capabilities for systematic bias detection and remediation.
