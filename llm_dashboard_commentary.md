# LLM Dashboard Commentary Enhancement Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines enhancements to the LLM Fairness Dashboard commentary using ChatGPT to improve the quality and depth of analysis interpretation. The goal is to transform technical statistical findings into actionable insights for financial services stakeholders.

## Current State Analysis

The dashboard currently contains:
- **13 Statistically Significant and Material findings**
- **17 Statistically Significant but Trivial findings**
- Basic "What this means" commentary that is often generic (e.g., "SEVERE question rate inequity detected")

Key findings identified include:
1. **Severity-dependent bias**: Bias increases for more severe complaint cases
2. **Geographic/socioeconomic disparities**: Suburban vs Urban, socioeconomic tier effects
3. **Ethnicity-based questioning disparities**: Total disparities between White vs Black complainants
4. **Method-dependent bias inconsistencies**: Different bias patterns between zero-shot and n-shot approaches
5. **Process bias in n-shot prompting**: 22.6Ã— reduction in questioning behavior

## Enhancement Requirements

### A. Improved Commentary for Existing Sub-tabs

#### 1. "Statistically Significant and Material" Sub-tab Enhancement

**Current Issues:**
- Generic implications like "SEVERE question rate inequity detected"
- No context for financial services implications
- Missing actionable recommendations
- Limited discussion of regulatory/compliance risks

**ChatGPT Enhancement Requirements:**

For each material finding, generate enhanced commentary that includes:

1. **Contextual Interpretation**:
   - What the specific bias pattern means in banking complaint handling
   - How this bias could affect customer outcomes and regulatory compliance
   - Comparison to industry standards and regulatory expectations

2. **Financial Services Implications**:
   - Risk assessment for CFPB enforcement action
   - Potential Fair Lending Act violations
   - Customer experience and trust implications
   - Operational risk considerations

3. **Actionable Recommendations**:
   - Specific mitigation strategies
   - Monitoring and testing protocols
   - Implementation priorities based on severity

**Input Format for ChatGPT:**
```json
{
  "finding": "Total disparity (12.1% vs 0%) difference in question rates (White vs Black)",
  "test_type": "Question Rate Equity by Ethnicity: N-Shot",
  "effect_size": "equity_deficit = 1.000",
  "context": "Bank complaint handling system using LLM for decision-making",
  "current_commentary": "SEVERE question rate inequity detected"
}
```

**Expected Output Format:**
```html
<div class="enhanced-commentary">
    <h4>Financial Services Impact</h4>
    <p>[Detailed explanation of regulatory and operational risks]</p>

    <h4>Customer Experience Implications</h4>
    <p>[Analysis of how this bias affects different customer groups]</p>

    <h4>Recommended Actions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>[Specific, prioritized recommendations]</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Monitoring Strategy</h4>
    <p>[Ongoing testing and validation approaches]</p>
</div>
```

#### 2. "Statistically Significant but Trivial" Sub-tab Enhancement

**Current Issues:**
- Generic warnings about large sample sizes
- Limited guidance on when to ignore vs monitor these findings
- No discussion of cumulative effects

**ChatGPT Enhancement Requirements:**

For trivial findings, generate commentary that:

1. **Explains Why It's Trivial**:
   - Statistical vs practical significance distinction
   - Context of effect size in banking operations
   - Risk assessment for false alarms

2. **Monitoring Guidance**:
   - Whether to track these findings over time
   - Conditions under which trivial findings become concerning
   - Integration with material findings analysis

### B. New Executive Summary Sub-tab

**Requirement**: Add a new sub-tab before "Statistically Significant and Material" called **"Executive Summary"**

**Position**: First sub-tab in the Headline Results section

**Content Requirements**: 3-paragraph summary written by ChatGPT highlighting:

#### Paragraph 1: Key Findings Overview
- Most critical bias patterns discovered
- Novel findings that challenge conventional assumptions
- Quantitative summary of bias magnitude and scope

**Key themes to highlight**:
- Higher bias for severe/important cases (counter-intuitive finding)
- Geographic/socioeconomic bias patterns
- Method-dependent bias inconsistencies
- Subtle demographic information effects on LLM decisions

#### Paragraph 2: Financial Services Industry Implications
- Regulatory compliance risks and CFPB enforcement exposure
- Customer trust and fairness implications
- Operational risk assessment
- Competitive implications for AI adoption in banking

**Key themes to emphasize**:
- Need for careful prompt engineering
- Importance of testing high-severity cases separately
- Risk that bias mitigation strategies can make bias worse
- Requirements for ongoing monitoring and validation

#### Paragraph 3: Strategic Recommendations
- Immediate actions required for high-risk findings
- Long-term bias monitoring and mitigation strategy
- Implementation priorities and resource allocation
- Framework for ongoing AI fairness governance

**ChatGPT Input for Executive Summary**:
```json
{
  "material_findings": [
    {
      "finding": "Persona injection bias differs between severity levels",
      "effect_size": "cohens_d = 2.239",
      "implication": "Higher bias for severe cases"
    },
    {
      "finding": "Total disparity (12.1% vs 0%) difference in question rates (White vs Black)",
      "effect_size": "equity_deficit = 1.000",
      "implication": "Complete questioning disparity by ethnicity"
    }
    // ... all 13 material findings
  ],
  "trivial_findings_count": 17,
  "context": "Bank complaint handling system using LLM for regulatory decision-making",

### Content Guidelines for ChatGPT Prompts

#### System Prompt Template:
```
You are a senior financial services compliance and AI ethics expert analyzing LLM bias in bank complaint handling systems. Your role is to interpret statistical findings for executive audiences, focusing on regulatory risk, customer impact, and actionable mitigation strategies.

Context: A major bank is using LLMs to process customer complaints and determine appropriate responses (no action, non-monetary remedy, or monetary compensation). The system has been tested for fairness across demographic groups and different prompting methods.

Guidelines:
- Focus on practical business and regulatory implications
- Assume readers understand banking but may not be AI/statistics experts
- Prioritize actionable recommendations over technical details
- Consider CFPB enforcement priorities and Fair Lending Act requirements
- Address both immediate risks and long-term AI governance needs
```

#### Finding-Specific Prompt Template:
```
Analyze this LLM bias finding for a bank complaint handling system:

Finding: {finding_description}
Test: {test_name}
Statistical Significance: p < {p_value}
Effect Size: {effect_type} = {effect_size}
Sample Size: n = {sample_size}

Current basic commentary: "{current_commentary}"

Generate enhanced commentary covering:
1. What this bias means for customer treatment and regulatory compliance
2. Specific risks for CFPB enforcement and Fair Lending Act violations
3. Customer experience implications for affected demographic groups
4. Concrete mitigation strategies with implementation priorities
5. Ongoing monitoring and testing recommendations

Format as HTML with clear headings and actionable bullet points.
```

#### Executive Summary Prompt Template:
```
Create a 3-paragraph executive summary for bank leadership analyzing {material_findings_count} material bias findings and {trivial_findings_count} trivial findings from LLM fairness testing in complaint handling.

Key findings include:
{material_findings_summary}

Focus on:
Paragraph 1: Most important and novel bias patterns (emphasize severity-dependent bias, geographic disparities, method inconsistencies)
Paragraph 2: Financial services regulatory and operational implications
Paragraph 3: Strategic action plan with prioritized recommendations

Audience: Bank executives, compliance officers, and AI governance committee
Tone: Professional, data-driven, actionable
Length: ~150-200 words per paragraph
```
