2024-01-15,Credit card or prepaid card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,BANK OF AMERICA,CA,"I noticed unauthorized charges on my credit card statement from last month. There were three transactions totaling $450 that I did not make. I immediately contacted the bank's fraud department and disputed the charges. They said they would investigate but it has been over 30 days and I haven't heard back. The charges are still on my statement and are accruing interest. I've called multiple times and each representative gives me different information. This is causing me significant financial stress as I'm being charged for purchases I didn't make. I need these fraudulent charges removed immediately and the interest reversed.",Web,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Yes
2024-01-20,Mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,WELLS FARGO,TX,"Due to unexpected medical expenses, I fell behind on my mortgage payments by two months. I contacted Wells Fargo to discuss options and was told I could apply for a loan modification. I submitted all required documents promptly. However, the bank keeps saying they haven't received my paperwork, even though I have confirmation numbers. They've now started foreclosure proceedings despite my attempts to work with them. I've been a customer for 15 years and this is my first time having difficulty with payments. The stress of potentially losing my home while dealing with medical issues is overwhelming. I need help getting the bank to work with me on a solution.",Phone,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Yes
2024-02-01,Bank account or service,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,CHASE,NY,"My checking account was charged $350 by a gym membership that I cancelled six months ago. I have written proof of the cancellation. When I contacted Chase to dispute the charge, they said it was a valid merchant transaction and refused to help. The gym is not responding to my calls. Chase is allowing this company to steal from my account even though I have proof I cancelled the service. This overdrafted my account and caused three other payments to bounce, resulting in $105 in overdraft fees. I need the unauthorized charge reversed and the overdraft fees waived.",Email,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Yes
2024-02-10,Student loan,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,NAVIENT,FL,"Navient is incorrectly reporting my student loans as defaulted on my credit report. I've been making regular payments through an income-driven repayment plan for the past two years. This error has dropped my credit score by over 100 points and I was denied a car loan because of it. I've disputed this with Navient three times and provided payment records, but they keep saying their records are correct. The credit bureaus won't remove it without Navient's confirmation. This error is severely impacting my ability to build credit and move forward with my life. I have all my payment confirmations and correspondence.",Mail,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,No
2024-02-15,Debt collection,Attempts to collect debt not owed,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES,IL,"Portfolio Recovery Associates is trying to collect a debt that isn't mine. They claim I owe $2,800 for a credit card I've never had. I've sent them multiple certified letters requesting validation of the debt, but they continue calling me daily, sometimes multiple times per day. They've threatened to garnish my wages and have started calling my employer. This harassment is affecting my work and causing extreme anxiety. I've never had an account with the original creditor they claim to represent. I need them to stop contacting me and remove this false debt from their records.",Web,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Yes
2024-03-01,Money transfer or virtual currency,Fraud or scam,PAYPAL,WA,"Someone hacked my PayPal account and sent $1,200 to an unknown recipient. I noticed it immediately and reported it to PayPal within an hour. They said they would investigate but then closed the case saying the transaction appeared authorized. I have never heard of the person who received the money. I've changed all my passwords and enabled two-factor authentication. PayPal is essentially saying I'm out $1,200 with no recourse. This was clearly fraud and their security failed to protect my account. I need this money refunded as it was my rent payment.",Phone,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Yes
2024-03-10,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,EQUIFAX,GA,"Equifax is showing seven hard inquiries on my credit report that I didn't authorize. These inquiries are from car dealerships in states I've never visited. This has damaged my credit score significantly. I've filed a police report for identity theft and sent it to Equifax with a dispute letter. They responded saying the inquiries were verified as accurate. How can inquiries in states I've never been to be accurate? I'm trying to buy a house and these false inquiries are preventing me from getting approved for a mortgage. This needs to be corrected immediately.",Email,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Yes
2024-03-15,Vehicle loan,Problem with the terms of your loan or lease,ALLY FINANCIAL,MI,"Ally Financial changed the terms of my auto loan without my consent. My payment increased by $75 per month with no explanation. When I called, they said it was due to an insurance adjustment, but I have always maintained full coverage and my insurance hasn't changed. They can't provide documentation showing why the payment increased. I've been making payments on time for three years. This unexpected increase is causing financial hardship. They're threatening repossession if I don't pay the increased amount, but I never agreed to this change.",Web,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Yes
2024-03-20,Prepaid card,Problem adding money,GREEN DOT,AZ,"I loaded $500 cash onto my Green Dot prepaid card at a retail location. The money was taken from me but never appeared on my card. It's been two weeks. Green Dot says they have no record of the transaction, but I have the receipt from the store. The store says they can't help because the transaction went through on their end. Green Dot customer service keeps hanging up on me when I try to explain. This was money for my daughter's school supplies and bills. I need my money credited to my card immediately.",Phone,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,No
2024-04-01,Bank account or service,Closing an account,US BANK,OH,"US Bank closed my checking account without warning and mailed me a check for the balance. When I tried to deposit the check at another bank, it bounced. US Bank is now saying I owed fees that depleted my balance, but I had over $3,000 in the account. They won't provide me with account statements or an explanation. This has caused multiple payments to fail and damaged my credit. I've been a customer for 8 years with no issues. I need my money returned and an explanation for why my account was closed.",Email,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Yes
