  - Bias directional consistency analysis  
  - Process fairness analysis (2 hypotheses with paired t-tests)
  - Severity bias variation (3 hypotheses including monetary vs non-monetary)
  - Complaint Categories analysis with complaint categorization
  - Fairness strategies effectiveness evaluation
  - Granular bias analysis
  - Scaling laws analysis

### nshot_fairness_analysis.py capabilities:
- **Basic statistical comparisons** only:
  - Simple t-tests between conditions
  - Chi-square tests for distribution differences
  - Effect size calculations (Cohen's d)
  - Basic correlation analysis

## Experimental Design Sophistication

### gpt-4o-mini-analysis.py:
- **Comprehensive demographic representation**: 24 personas (4 ethnicities × 3 geographies × 2 genders)
- **Multiple bias mitigation strategies**: 7 different approaches tested systematically
- **Paired experimental design**: Each complaint gets baseline + 20 experimental conditions (10 personas + 10 strategy variants)
- **Reproducible sampling**: Fixed RNG seed with persistent sampling index
- **Process fairness indicators**: 6 different process metrics (monetary, escalation, questions, etc.)

### nshot_fairness_analysis.py:
- **Limited demographic personas**: 6 personas only
- **N-shot prompting focus**: Uses examples in prompts rather than systematic persona injection
- **Single experiment type**: DPP + nearest neighbors approach
- **Limited process indicators**: Basic remedy decision only

## Report Generation and Visualization

### gpt-4o-mini-analysis.py:
- **Comprehensive academic reports**: Full statistical methodology documentation
- **Multiple output formats**: JSON analysis files + Markdown reports + visualizations
- **Hypothesis-driven reporting**: Each analysis section has formal hypothesis testing structure
- **Professional academic formatting**: Ready for peer review and publication

### nshot_fairness_analysis.py:
- **Basic reporting**: Simple statistical summaries
- **Limited visualizations**: Basic plots and charts
- **Descriptive analysis**: More exploratory than hypothesis-driven

## Integration with Advanced Framework

### gpt-4o-mini-analysis.py:
- **Full integration** with `AdvancedFairnessAnalyzer` class
- **Modular statistical analyzer**: Leverages sophisticated statistical methods
- **Professional report generator**: Automated academic-quality report generation
- **Extensible architecture**: Easy to add new analyses

### nshot_fairness_analysis.py:
- **Self-contained**: All analysis logic built into single script
- **Limited extensibility**: Adding new analyses requires significant code changes
- **Manual reporting**: Results need manual interpretation and formatting

## Unique N-Shot Capabilities (What nshot_fairness_analysis.py HAS that gpt-4o-mini-analysis.py does NOT)

### nshot_fairness_analysis.py unique capabilities:
1. **Determinantal Point Processes (DPP)**: Sophisticated example selection for diversity
2. **N-shot prompting**: Uses example-based prompting rather than persona injection
3. **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity**: Advanced text similarity matching for nearest neighbors
4. **Example diversity optimization**: Algorithmic selection of diverse training examples
5. **Ground truth comparison**: Attempts to estimate and compare against "true" outcomes
6. **Self-contained ML pipeline**: Includes feature extraction, similarity computation, and example selection

## Upgrade Recommendations for nshot_fairness_analysis.py

To bring `nshot_fairness_analysis.py` up to parity with `gpt-4o-mini-analysis.py`, consider implementing:

### 1. Statistical Analysis Integration
```python
# Import the advanced statistical analyzer
from fairness_analysis import StatisticalAnalyzer

# Add comprehensive statistical tests
statistical_analyzer = StatisticalAnalyzer()
analyses = {
    "demographic_injection": statistical_analyzer.analyze_demographic_injection_effect(results),
    "gender_effects": statistical_analyzer.analyze_gender_effects(results),
    "ethnicity_effects": statistical_analyzer.analyze_ethnicity_effects(results),
    # ... etc
}
```

### 2. Expanded Demographic Framework
- Increase from 6 to 24 personas covering all intersectional identities
- Add systematic persona injection alongside n-shot prompting
- Implement paired experimental design with matched baseline/treatment pairs

### 3. Process Fairness Metrics
Expand beyond simple remedy tier to include:
- Monetary remedy indicators
- Escalation tracking
- Question asking patterns
- Evidence sufficiency assessments
- Response format quality
- Service refusal rates

### 4. Report Generation Module
```python
from fairness_analysis import ReportGenerator

# Generate comprehensive academic reports
report_generator = ReportGenerator(results_dir)
report_generator.generate_comprehensive_report("nshot_analysis_results.md")
```

### 5. Reproducible Sampling
- Implement persistent sampling index with fixed RNG seed
- Store sampling metadata for exact replication
- Add audit trail for case selection

### 6. Hypothesis-Driven Analysis
Transform exploratory analysis into formal hypothesis testing:
- Define null and alternative hypotheses for each analysis
- Apply appropriate statistical tests with corrections for multiple comparisons
- Report effect sizes with confidence intervals
- Include power analysis considerations

### 7. Modular Architecture
Refactor monolithic script into modular components:
```
nshot_fairness_analysis/
├── __init__.py
├── data_loader.py
├── dpp_selector.py
├── statistical_analyzer.py
├── report_generator.py
├── experiment_runner.py
└── visualization.py
```

## Summary

**gpt-4o-mini-analysis.py** is designed for **comprehensive statistical analysis and academic research** with:
- Systematic bias detection across multiple dimensions
- Rigorous hypothesis testing with proper statistical methods  
- Professional academic reporting
- Reproducible experimental methodology

**nshot_fairness_analysis.py** is designed for **algorithmic prompting optimization** with:
- Sophisticated example selection using DPP and similarity metrics
- N-shot learning approach to bias mitigation
- Focus on prompt engineering rather than systematic bias analysis
- More experimental/research-oriented approach to LLM prompting

The key difference is that `gpt-4o-mini-analysis.py` leverages a mature statistical analysis framework for comprehensive bias research, while `nshot_fairness_analysis.py` focuses on advanced prompting techniques and example selection algorithms.

## Potential Hybrid Approach

The ideal solution would combine both approaches:
1. Use DPP and similarity metrics from `nshot_fairness_analysis.py` for intelligent example selection
2. Apply the comprehensive statistical framework from `gpt-4o-mini-analysis.py` for analysis
3. Test whether n-shot prompting with diverse examples provides better bias mitigation than persona injection alone
4. Compare the effectiveness of example-based prompting vs explicit mitigation strategies

This would create a best-of-both-worlds solution that leverages sophisticated ML techniques for prompt optimization while maintaining rigorous statistical analysis for bias detection and quantification.
